# library
Project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For this project, I created a library page where you can click to add a book and a form pops up. Upon submit, the Book constructor is activated, and the book's information is stored as an object in an array. A "card" is added containing the book's information with a button that shows either Read or Not Read (and toggles between the two on click).

I also added a remove button for each "card", using the Book constructor prototype and an eventListener for functionality.
